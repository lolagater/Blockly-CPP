Continuation of development of Blockly for use in Education

With the exponential expansion of Computer Science in the modern world, the need to teach novice programmers has become more important than ever. Using the already established code generator Blockly, we can create a user-friendly interface that allows for ease of visualization and writing to accelerate the learning process for people without prior coding experience. Our goal is to eventually be able to finish the C++ curriculum solely using the interface provided by Blockly. Our implementation will involve the debugging and optimization of existing code created by previous QCC students. Specifically, with the development of file creation and Inheritance, and potentially further. The code will be mostly written in JavaScript, with a small amount of CSS / HTML and will involve the improvement of the front-end deployment as well.
